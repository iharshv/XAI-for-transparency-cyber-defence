# üîç ExplainAI: Transparent Intrusion Detection Using XAI

## üö® Problem Statement

Traditional AI-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) are effective but lack transparency, making it difficult for cybersecurity analysts to trust or act upon AI decisions. This project introduces explainability using SHAP and LIME to make ML-driven threat detection interpretable and actionable.
