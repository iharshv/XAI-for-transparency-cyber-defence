Malicious Connection Detection using Explainable AI

🔧 Problem Statement

With the surge in internet traffic and evolving cyber threats, identifying malicious network connections is critical. Traditional detection methods often act as black boxes, lacking transparency and interpretability. This project aims to build a lightweight Explainable AI (XAI) tool that:

Detects malicious connections based on network traffic features

Provides transparent reasoning using feature importance

Helps security analysts understand and validate alerts

📁 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository

https://github.com/yourusername/malicious-connection-xai.git
cd malicious-connection-xai

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the tool

python main.py

You will see an output that classifies a test network connection and shows a feature importance graph.

🗃️ Screenshots & Logs

Classification Output Example:

Feature Importance for Malicious Connection Prediction
[src_bytes] --> 0.304
[dst_bytes] --> 0.295
[duration]  --> 0.287
[flag]      --> 0.058
[protocol]  --> 0.056

This connection is malicious.
